# Management of several servers using Ansible

So in the previous assignment you added a server to the interface. This enabled you to manage two servers using the cockpit interface. But it is still not super efficient way to manage lots of servers.

Lets say you have 20 linux servers in your infrastructure. And a serious software vulnerability is found in a base-package present in all these 20 servers. Now you will need to click 20 times on the update software button.

So instead we propose using an automation framework that can help relive you of repetative tasks like updating software by hand.

## Setup of ansible master

## Run ad hoc commands against your linux servers

## Run ad hoc commands against your windows server
