# Why Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is “Linux for all”
There’s no doubting that Linux underpins modern IT innovation - from Linux containers and Kubernetes to AI and IoT, Linux is the bedrock for the next-generation of computing. But the rise of Linux puts renewed focus on the skills and expertise to effectively manage and deploy Linux-based system. These are skills that not every IT department has, which can limit an organization’s ability to fully digitally transform on top of Linux.

In Red Hat’s view, this problem can be solved by lowering many of the common entry barriers to Linux, including the “fear of the command line.” Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, the latest version of the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform, abstracts away many of the complexities of Linux through a graphical web console, automation and embedded intelligence. Together, these capabilities create an enterprise-grade Linux operating system that still fuels innovation and provides stability for product applications, but is actually, well, usable.
