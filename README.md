# Linux workshop for Enterprise administrators

This workshop aims to get people with limited or no experience of Linux a good foundation to start. While it does deal with some of the theory, it focuses on hands on experience of common tasks that a system administrator likely will have to do. 

This workshop has been written specifically for people with some previous experience of the Windows operating system but works for anyone who is new to Linux.

This workshop uses ```Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8```, but acquired knowledge is often applicable for many different Linux operating systems.
